    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        Ali was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. He began training as an amateur boxer at age 12. At 18, he won
        a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics and turned professional later that
        year. He became a Muslim after 1961.

    <h2>Historical fights</h2>
    <p>
        He was involved in several historic boxing matches and feuds, most notably his fights with Joe Frazier, such as
        the Fight of the Century, which has been called "the biggest boxing event, if not the biggest sporting event, of
        all time" and the Thrilla in Manila, and also his fight with George Foreman, known as The Rumble in the Jungle,
        which was watched by a record estimated television audience of 1 billion viewers worldwide, becoming the world's
        most-watched live television broadcast at the time. Ali thrived in the spotlight at a time when many fighters
        let their managers do the talking, and he was often provocative and outlandish. He was known for trash-talking,
        and often free-styled with rhyme schemes and spoken word poetry, anticipating elements of hip hop

    <h2>Entertainment career</h2>
    <p>
        Ali had a cameo role in the 1962 film version of Requiem for a Heavyweight, and during his exile from boxing, he
        starred in the short-lived 1969 Broadway musical, Buck White. He also appeared in the documentary film Black
        Rodeo (1972) riding both a horse and a bull.His autobiography The Greatest: My Own Story, written with Richard
        Durham, was published in 1975. In 1977 the
        book was adapted into a film called The Greatest, in which Ali played himself and Ernest Borgnine played Angelo
        Dundee.The film Freedom Road, made in 1978, features Ali in a rare acting role as Gideon Jackson, a former slave
        and
        Union (American Civil War) soldier in 1870s Virginia, who gets elected to the U.S. Senate and battles other
        former slaves and white sharecroppers to keep the land they have tended all their lives.
